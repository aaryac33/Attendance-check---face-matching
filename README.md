# Attendance-check---face-matching
This code is using DeepFace framework. It takes input as a 'database folder' of a person's images(face) and 2 input images of the same person. Then it analyses the input image, makes bounding boxes, finds similarities with the second image and also calculates the age and gender from the image.
